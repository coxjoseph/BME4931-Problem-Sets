This Repository Contains all the Problem Sets/Tutorials and necessary data to run them for BME4931. All sets are authored by me, and licesnsed under GPL 3.0 or any later version.

Sources for data are cited in the Problem Set they originate from. If no source is cited, the dataset was generated by me (and the script for generating it is found in the solutions file of the module.) 
Generally speaking, the data I created was generated completely randomly.

(This README is a WIP)
