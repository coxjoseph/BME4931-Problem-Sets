# Osteoporosis Dataset

This dataset, "osteoporosis.csv," contains information related to bone health and the risk of osteoporosis. Samples and measurements were taken from 150 patients at an undisclosed state hospital. The goal of providing this dataset publicly is to aid in the 
automatic diagnosis of risk factors for osteoporosis. 

## Data Description 

The csv file contains includes the following columns:

- **ID**: Each patient is assigned a unique, de-identified ID for identification purposes.
- **BoneLength_cm**: Represents the length of a specific bone, measured in centimeters.
- **T3_Level_ng/dL**: Reflects the level of the T3 hormone in the patient's blood, measured in nanograms per deciliter.
- **CalciumLevel_mg/dL**: Indicates the level of calcium in the patient's blood, measured in milligrams per deciliter.
- **T-Score**: Represents the T-Score for bone density, which is a measure of bone health.
- **Osteoporosis**: The target variable, classifying the risk level of osteoporosis as determined by an independent panel of clinicians. This row takes on 1 of 3 values: LR (Low Risk), MR (Medium Risk), or HR (High Risk).
